Minimo supports the following clients for the search feature:

- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com)
- [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com)

Follow the following steps for enabling search in your site.

## Create Search Page

First of all, you'll need to create a search page.

Create a markdown file under `/content/page/` directory with the filename `search`. If your site is multilingual, you can include language code in the filename. For example:

- `/content/page/search.md`
- `/content/page/search.en.md`

Add the following options in the frontmatter:

```yaml
type: page
layout: search
outputs:
  - html
  - json
```

## Select Search Client

For selecting the client for search feature, use the following options in your `config.toml` file:

```toml
[params.search]
client = ""
```

- `params.search` [`Map`]:
  - `client` [`String`]: Name of the Search Client (_supported values:_ `algolia`,`lunr`)

## Client Specific Steps

The next steps are different for each search client:

- [**Algolia**]({{< relref "docs/search-algolia.md" >}})
- [**Lunr.js**]({{< relref "docs/search-lunr-js.md" >}})

After you complete those steps, you are good to go!
