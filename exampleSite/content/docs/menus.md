Minimo has two menus.

1. Main Menu
2. Social Menu

## Minimo Main Menu

Main menu is located at the top of the site.

Check [Hugo's Menus Documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/) for information about managing this menu.

## Minimo Social Menu

Social menu is located at the footer of the site.

Use the `[params.social]` variables in the site's configuration for adding your social profiles.

You only have to add your usernames. Minimo will take care of the rest.
