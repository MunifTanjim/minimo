First of all you will need to setup a Hugo site. You can follow the [Hugo's Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for that.

After you're done with that, it's time for installing Minimo!

## Installing Minimo

There are two different ways you can install Minimo:

1. As clone
2. As submodule

_The second method is recommended._

#### Install Minimo as clone

With this method, you will simply clone it. And a copy of Minimo's repository will be stored with the rest of you site. Enter the following command for cloning Minimo:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo themes/minimo
```

#### Install Minimo as submodule

This method doesn't store a copy of Minimo's repository inside your site's repository. Rather it adds Minimo as a dependency. Start by this command:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo themes/minimo
```

This will add Minimo's repository as a submodule to your site's repository. Now, you will have to pull the theme:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

That's all, Minimo is ready to be used.

## Configuration for Minimo

For getting started with Minimo, copy the **`config.toml`** file from the **`exampleSite`** directory inside Minimo's repository to your site repository:

```sh
cp themes/minimo/exampleSite/config.toml .
```

You can take a look at the [example **`config.toml`**](/docs/example-config-toml) file.

Now, you can start editing this file and change the configuration!

### Setting up Authors

Follow the [Authors Setup Guide](/docs/authors) for setting up authors for you site.

-------------

Et voil√†! Minimo is ready!
